# Main objective

## The main objective of our research is to develop a comprehensive system for real-time emotion detection and mental health monitoring for remote employees. This system will utilize various technologies such as smartwatches, social media analysis, and environmental tracking to gather relevant data and provide insights into the emotional well-being and mental health of remote employees. By monitoring and understanding their emotional states and mental health conditions, we aim to enhance employee well-being, productivity, and overall job satisfaction in remote work settings.

# Main Research questions

 How can real-time emotion detection be effectively integrated into the work environment of remote employees?

 How can social media behavior analysis help in identifying and understanding the emotions of remote employees?

 How can stress levels, depression levels, and sleep quality be accurately measured using smartwatches, and how do these factors impact employee mental health?

 What are the key environmental factors that influence remote employee motivation, and how can they be tracked and optimized to enhance performance?
